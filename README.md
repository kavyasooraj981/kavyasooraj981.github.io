## Welcome!

This repository contains some of my work related to GIS and remote sensing.

### An analysis of surface water and ground water situation in Bengaluru 

This was a project done as part of CDAC PGDGi programme. See [this page](https://kavyasooraj981.github.io/dashboardfinal.html) for the report of this work. 

#### Abstract
As cities are emerging tremendously with ever increasing population and creating
a stress on urban infrastructure and most importantly on natural resources, the
project focuses on the issue of urbanization on the surface and ground water of
Bengaluru, the world's fastest growing city in GDP (Bengaluru Innovation
Report,2019), and third most populous city in India.
The project aims to map the surface water and ground water scenario of
Bengaluru. As the first part of the project, surface water analysis which includes
urbanization and water quality have been considered. The lakes of Bengaluru
have been considered for surface water analysis as they are currently in threat due
to encroachment activities and pollution. The urbanization parameters include
built up area, vegetation area, road network length, industrial area, and surface
temperature which have been considered to perform buffer analysis around lakes
to observe change for a decade from 2000 to 2019. The water quality is further
measured using remote sensing band-ratio technique to compute its different
parameters of chlorophyll, and turbidity and DOM. The surface temperature of
lakes is also an important parameter of water quality measurement. The second
part of the project aims to to identify the ground water prospects of Bengaluru
Urban District using GIS and Remote sensing techniques. Furthermore, to
understand Bengaluruâ€™s ground water scenario, the ground water potential is
mapped considering factors such as rainfall, lineament, landcover, slope, soil
type, and lithology. These are mapped using weighted overlay analysis and an
AHP process to understand which areas have a higher potential of ground water.
Traditional methods like Dowsing, scientific methods like electrical resistivity
method, Slingram, VLF methods provided accurate results , but only for a smaller
area. Remote sensing and GIS helps in better decision making, at a wide scale of
area. The final step of the project is to map these layers of water scenario into a
dashboard using front-end software of leaflet, and R programming
