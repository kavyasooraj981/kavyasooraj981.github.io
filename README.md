## An analysis of surface water and ground water situation in Bengaluru 

Indian cities are growing fast and creating a stress on urban infrastructure and most importantly on natural resources. This project focuses on the changes in the surface and ground water in Bengaluru, the world's fastest growing city in GDP (Bengaluru Innovation Report,2019), and the third most populous city in India.
In the first part, surface water analysis which includes urbanization and water quality have been considered. The lakes of Bengaluru have been considered for surface water analysis as they are currently in threat due to encroachment activities and pollution. The urbanization parameters include built up area, vegetation area, road network length, industrial area, and surface temperature which have been considered to perform buffer analysis around lakes to observe change for a decade from 2000 to 2019. Water quality is measured using remote sensing band-ratio technique to compute its different parameters of chlorophyll, and turbidity and DOM. The surface temperature of lakes is also an important parameter of water quality measurement. The second part of the project aims to to identify the ground water prospects of Bengaluru Urban district using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Furthermore, to understand Bengaluruâ€™s ground water scenario, ground water potential is mapped considering factors such as rainfall, lineament, landcover, slope, soil
type, and lithology. These are mapped using weighted overlay analysis and an AHP process to understand which areas have a higher potential of ground water. Traditional methods like Dowsing, scientific methods like electrical resistivity method, Slingram, VLF methods provided accurate results , but only for a smaller area. Remote sensing and GIS helps in better decision making, at a wide scale of area. The final step of the project is to map these layers of water scenario into a dashboard using front-end software of leaflet, and R programming language. flexdashboard package was used to make the dashboard.

This was a project done as part of CDAC PGDGi programme. See **[this page](https://kavyasooraj981.github.io/dashboardfinal.html)** for the web dashboard produced as the output of this work.
